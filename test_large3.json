The vertical is perfect. So we are using the wrong ratio at least for this machine. Not sure how this changes on other machines\r\n3) the grey rectangle is perfect in its dimensions, but the triangle does not finish where the grey triangle finishes\r\n4) when a person sees the triangle at different zoom levels (zooming in or out of a page, for example if he has a very big monitor, or a very small one, or he cannot see very well) the triangle size does not change in a smooth way.\r\n\r\nNote also that there is no effective need to keep a grey background around the triangle, so taking that away might not solve the ratio of the triangle, but at least make it look less ugly."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fairdemocracy/vilfredo-client/issues/comments/68489969","html_url":"https://github.com/fairdemocracy/vilfredo-client/issues/86#issuecomment-68489969","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fairdemocracy/vilfredo-client/issues/86","id":68489969,"user":{"login":"giovanisp","id":180794,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180794?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovanisp","html_url":"https://github.com/giovanisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovanisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovanisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovanisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovanisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovanisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovanisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovanisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovanisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovanisp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:53:49Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:53:49Z","body":"I try to do that whenever I can.

Considering the implications of something like this, it'd be ideal to roll it into the core plugin, but may require breaking some currently valid URLs.\r\n\r\nThe basic premise is that URLs can be signed using a unique string, in this case `wp_salt()`, and when requested, the token can be checked to ensure none of the variables in the query string have been tampered with. This allows for passing non-sensitive data through the URL in the clear and being certain that it hasn't been changed. It essentially allows for more secure and concise URLs.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\nMy implementation is available here for anyone wanting to try it out and offer feedback on how it could be improved or integrated: https://github.com/bradyvercher/EDD-Signed-URLs\r\n\r\nThe first three functions simply hook into EDD to modify and check the URLs, while the last three functions provide the API for signing URLs.\r\n\r\nThe concept will work with any URL structure, so my method of condensing everything into a colon delimited `eddfile` query arg isn't required (and that arg could even be renamed with a simple filter if desired).\r\n\r\n### Breakage\r\n\r\nAs far as potentially breaking changes, existing URLs that haven't expired would quit working with this solution. It might be possible to run things side by side for a short while, but the current method would need to be deprecated at some point.\r\n\r\nThis would also decrease the reliance on using the `download_key` to look up a payment, instead using actual payment IDs, which might make things a little easier to work with. In that case, the current API utilizing the `download_key` might need to be augmented, or a new solution could be run side by side. I'm not sure if anyone is using the existing functions directly or not.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\nIn any case, we're opening this up to see if anyone has ideas on implementing a solution like this without breaking anything. Feedback about improvements, suggestions on the default URL structure (is it worth trying to simplify?), and increasing security is welcome.\r\n\r\nFeel free to correct me if I got anything wrong, Pippin."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/easydigitaldownloads/Easy-Digital-Downloads/issues/comments/68489973","html_url":"https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/Easy-Digital-Downloads/issues/603#issuecomment-68489973","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/easydigitaldownloads/Easy-Digital-Downloads/issues/603","id":68489973,"user":{"login":"pippinsplugins","id":1034109,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1034109?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pippinsplugins","html_url":"https://github.com/pippinsplugins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pippinsplugins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pippinsplugins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pippinsplugins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pippinsplugins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pippinsplugins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pippinsplugins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pippinsplugins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pippinsplugins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pippinsplugins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:53:57Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:53:57Z","body":"Hmm, that's a good point.

It appears that the default instance implementation of toJSON detects and automatically serializes any eagerly loaded associations on the model. However, the name that the associations are loaded under is the capitalized and pluralized name of the association. So if I have a 'Topic' model with a 'Category' association such that `Topic.belongsTo(Category)`, if I eagerly load the category with the topic, I get `topic.Category`. Obviously this is a trivial example but I'm wondering if there is some way to access a list of eagerly loaded associations from within the toJSON() instance method so that I can programmatically rename and serialize all of the eagerly loaded associations?"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sequelize/sequelize/issues/comments/68490000","html_url":"https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/2493#issuecomment-68490000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sequelize/sequelize/issues/2493","id":68490000,"user":{"login":"mickhansen","id":699049,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/699049?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen","html_url":"https://github.com/mickhansen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:55:29Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:55:29Z","body":"@memelet depends on what you want to do"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:55:29Z","org":{"id":3591786,"login":"sequelize","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/sequelize","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3591786?"}}

One\nof the more widely used libraries today is libserialize, Rust's current solution\nfor encoding and decoding types.\n\nThe current libserialize library, however, has a number of drawbacks:\n\n* The API is not ready to be stabilize as-is and we will likely not have enough\n  resources to stabilize the API for 1.0.\n* The library is not necessarily the speediest implementations with alternatives\n  being developed out-of-tree (e.g. serde from erickt).\n* It is not clear how the API of Encodable/Decodable can evolve over time while\n  maintaining backwards compatibility.\n\nOne of the major pros to the current libserialize, however, is\n`deriving(Encodable, Decodable)` as short-hands for enabling serializing and\ndeserializing a type. This is unambiguously useful functionality, so we cannot\nsimply deprecate the in-tree libserialize in favor of an external crates.io\nimplementation.\n\nFor these reasons, this commit starts off a stability story for libserialize by\nfollowing these steps:\n\n1. The deriving(Encodable, Decodable) modes will be deprecated in favor of a\n   renamed deriving(RustcEncodable, RustcDecodable).\n2. The in-tree libserialize will be deprecated in favor of an external\n   rustc-serialize crate shipped on crates.io. The contents of the crate will be\n   the same for now (but they can evolve separately).\n3. At 1.0 serialization will be performed through\n   deriving(RustcEncodable, RustcDecodable) and the rustc-serialize crate. The\n   expansions for each deriving mode will change from `::serialize::foo` to\n   `::rustc_serialize::foo`.\n\nThis story will require that the compiler freezes its implementation of\n`RustcEncodable` deriving for all of time, but this should be a fairly minimal\nmaintenance burden. Otherwise the crate in crates.io must always maintain the\nexact definition of its traits, but the implementation of json, for example, can\ncontinue to evolve in the semver-sense.\n\nThe major goal for this stabilization effort is to pave the road for a new\nofficial serialization crate which can replace the current one, solving many of\nits downsides in the process. We are not assuming that this will exist for 1.0,\nhence the above measures. Some possibilities for replacing libserialize include:\n\n* If plugins have a stable API, then any crate can provide a custom `deriving`\n  mode (will require some compiler work). This means that any new serialization\n  crate can provide its own `deriving` with its own backing\n  implementation, entirely obsoleting the current libserialize and fully\n  replacing it.\n\n* Erick is exploring the possibility of code generation via preprocessing Rust\n  source files in the near term until plugins are stable. This strategy would\n  provide the same ergonomic benefit that `deriving` does today in theory.\n\nSo, in summary, the current libserialize crate is being deprecated in favor of\nthe crates.io-based rustc-serialize crate where the `deriving` modes are\nappropriately renamed. This opens up space for a later implementation of\nserialization in a more official capacity while allowing alternative\nimplementations to be explored in the meantime.\n\nConcretely speaking, this change adds support for the `RustcEncodable` and\n`RustcDecodable` deriving modes. After a snapshot is made warnings will be\nturned on for usage of `Encodable` and `Decodable` as well as deprecating the\nin-tree libserialize crate to encurage users to use rustc-serialize instead.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodakai/rust/commits/7d1fa4ebea3cb29d76d04199e3a015ab11974914"},{"sha":"f053f29ff5469ff955221d1ea8d6154ef276ce10","author":{"email":"1fa2ef4755a9226cb9a0a4840bd89b158ac71391@whoosh.ca","name":"mchaput"},"message":"Fix mispelling in char.rs error message\n\nError message has wrong spelling (\"radix is to high\").","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodakai/rust/commits/f053f29ff5469ff955221d1ea8d6154ef276ce10"},{"sha":"ac7dc03a52d94fe62c367e4783d0a8b915554b75","author":{"email":"0e9d9283f1e2e7101413c9b37446e5bea98c5425@csclub.uwaterloo.ca","name":"Luqman Aden"},"message":"libsyntax: Make deriving also respect where bounds.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodakai/rust/commits/ac7dc03a52d94fe62c367e4783d0a8b915554b75"},{"sha":"ab1bdde536668e752aaf4e9dbfa0acf058d0240b","author":{"email":"0e9d9283f1e2e7101413c9b37446e5bea98c5425@csclub.uwaterloo.ca","name":"Luqman Aden"},"message":"libsyntax: Output where clauses in pretty printer for structs.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodakai/rust/commits/ab1bdde536668e752aaf4e9dbfa0acf058d0240b"},{"sha":"c2b0d7dd8818a0dca9b1fa7af6873375907f05ca","author":{"email":"46f1a0bd5592a2f9244ca321b129902a06b53e03@randomhacks.net","name":"Eric Kidd"},"message":"Modify `regex::Captures::{at,name}` to return `Option`\n\nCloses #14602.

I'm not sure why, as I don't think it has anything to do with my changes. Perhaps it's something else that has changed on the branch? In any case, I think we probably want those to be left-aligned (except maybe the button), but this way at least the gfx test passes on my machine.

To make Chrome safer, we disabled some extensions that aren't listed in the Chrome Web Store and may have been added without your knowledge.\r\n\r\n - HTTPS Everywhere\"\r\n\r\nOn the Extensions page, HTTPS Everywhere is greyed out, disabled, and the checkbox to re-enable it is greyed out. Enabling developer mode doesn't fix it, nor does dragging in the .crx again. Deleting the extension and dragging back in the .crx works until the next restart.\r\n\r\nWe should ask Google about this."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EFForg/https-everywhere/issues/comments/68490056","html_url":"https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere/issues/819#issuecomment-68490056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EFForg/https-everywhere/issues/819","id":68490056,"user":{"login":"NewEraCracker","id":416945,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/416945?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEraCracker","html_url":"https://github.com/NewEraCracker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEraCracker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEraCracker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEraCracker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEraCracker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEraCracker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEraCracker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEraCracker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEraCracker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEraCracker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:57:29Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:57:29Z","body":"There are two options to workaround this.\r\n\r\nOne is extracting the CRX to a new folder in the computer and use programing mode to load the extension from the folder.\r\n\r\nAnother one is, the one I use for archival purposes, download the CRX from Chrome webstore using \"Give me CRX\": https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/give-me-crx/acpimoebmfjpfnbhjgdgiacjfebmmmci\r\n\r\nApparently there is some method of certificate authentication in CRX files and those downloaded from eff's website mismatch the copies at google's servers.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nNewEraCracker"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:57:29Z","org":{"id":2120271,"login":"EFForg","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/EFForg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2120271?"}}
